# FaceMaskDetectionDL
My project is a Face Mask Detection system utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Deep Learning techniques. Using a live video feed and camera, the system accurately identifies whether a person is wearing a mask or not, providing real-time feedback. By leveraging advanced CNN algorithms, it enhances safety measures by automatically detecting compliance with mask-wearing protocols.
